# eye-extraction-and-js-cpp-wrapper
This is part of a project I was working on for Netlyt called MindPeek. It is a web application so we needed it to follow a user's gaze in JavaScript but we also needed the speed of C++. So one of my responsibilities was to develop a C++ module with OpenCV that detects and extracts the face and eyes of a person from a webcam feed. I also built a v8 JS wrapper. This serves to demonstrate my abilities to use various technologies concerning C++, operate dynamic memory and wrap C++ in other languages. 

The rest of the code for MindPeek is in BitBucket and uploaded this module exclusively. All the other modules are excluded for non-disclosure reasons.
